##Tracking map on Android

*Note: this is originally based on [my other repo][1], 
but it has been changed drastically therefore I think it would be easier to just create another new version.
The old one still works, but from now I will only update this version.*

###What's new 2012.07.19
- Now be able to keep tracking indoor using Network location provider
- Location update interval for GPS is 2s, Network is 30s

###What could it do
- start the background process to periodically track user's location (GPS enabled)
- for every point it records, it also obtain nearby places via Google Places API
- store data and meta info into local database
- an icon on notification bar to indicate the running process and also be able to go back to the app
- start/stop functions
- export location data (to "sdcard/tracking/")
- draw points on map based on the data
- create log file automatically

###Dependencies
- Android support library: could downloaded via Android SDK manager
- Google API Java client
- Google Place API sample from [ddewaele][2], [updated][3] to be compatible with the
  newest version of google API

###Issues
- You have to obtain your own google api key.
- map drawing not real time

Feel free to fork it; have fun.
